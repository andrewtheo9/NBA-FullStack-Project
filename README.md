# SEIR-1212 Project 2: NBA-Project

## NBA-Project

For my project 2 I decided to make an app that tracks NBA players that are in contention for the MVP award. The user can see the player's statistics on the season, and if they are logged in then they can leave a comment discussing the player's season thus far. In addition, the logged in user can also add a player who they believe is in contention for the MVP.
